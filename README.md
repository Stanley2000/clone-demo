WHAT IS WRONG WITH NIGERIA
The rhetorical question is now a conventional statement. You hear it from every Nigerian, even those who are pu
rpotedly richb
The reason is not farfetched, the economy is in shambles; The polity is in disarry; Secession claims have permeated the nation . Even the recent claim of 'independence' by a certain group from the South west region was another cause for alar. While the grounds for agitations are logical, it is a however clear tha it has never solved any known problem inthe world.

According to the United Nation, there are 192 countries in the world, after Montengro joined the UN in 2006 ; There are also three independent states which are the Vaxtican, Taiwan, and Palestine, totaling 195. In additon, there states with unsolved plotical conflicts, and they include Somaliland, Kkosoco, western Sahara, Northen Iraq among others . In total, there avout 246 of them.

Whichever angle you see it from, whether from the perspective of the UN or you want to add the independent states or even  the states with political conflicts, all of them put together are not up to the number of ethnic groups in Nigeria, which are about 300 in total. This presupposes a natural ground for conflict,abunding in internecine skirishes.

However, this is a nation that is supposed to become better as a result of her diversities. We are supposed to hauness alll the natural resouces to make us better. Nigeria, being the most populous black nation in the world,has the capacity to become the best in the world.
Nigeria is merely an entity; the  who reside in it and have the status of belonging to the nation, are called Nigerians It therefore means that what we put in is what we get.Nigeria is innocent, not guilty of any fraud or atrocities we commit. Nigerians are guilty. How much love do we have for one another? An example of the no love lost among Nigerians is the experience of a Nigerian man who was thoroughly interviewed at the Nigerian embassy . Even after stating his reason for traveling, the interviewer intentionnslly chose to delay him, thereby frustrating him . the man was not unknown to the woman due to the mutual nationality but, at that point, monetary gratification was vital. Realising that the woman was Yoruba, he eventually bade the in her native language. He however encountered a different senerio when  got to the zambian embassy . The  interviewer, upon discovering that he was from Nigeria, told him how he loved Nigerians . Ironically, Nigerians dont love one another. This is not the same for some other countries.


Following the tragic chapecoense incident, both Willian and Dacid Luiz dedicated their goals to the Brazilians. Daniel Alves was the first to welcome Neymar Junior to France when he arrived. There is absolutely nothing wrong with Nigeria.

Thus, why is everyone complaining when it is evident that not every one is making contribution to ensure the contry becomes better? You can also stay uneducated or half educated, and still blame Nigeria after all, there are Nigerians who are making us very proud. In 2018, a Nigerian surgeon Dr Oluyinka Olutoye removed a 23 weeks baby from a womans womb, performed surgery on it ad retuned it back for the woman to deliver the child normally. More so , there are about 15% Nigerians in the Uk parliament. Even Donald Trump chose a Nigerian as a member of his advisory committe.

what of Akinlye Agbaje and David Oyelowo in the Hollywood? They shot a movie on the life of Dr Bennet Omalu, a Nigerian American Neuropathologist. Mohammed Barkindo wasalso recently appointed as the Secretary General of OPEC. The list is inexhastible. However,, wht are you doing for Nigeria?

It is therefore imperative that all Nigerians pledge to make the nation better. there is an urget need to stop using the current situation as an excuse. Nothing is wrong with Nigeria, we all need to stop shooting Nigeria, as words carry enough weight.
